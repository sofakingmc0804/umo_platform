# Sprint 0.0 Failure Report

**Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Sprint:** 0.0 - Local Environment Provisioning  
**Task:** 0.0.1 - Install Flutter SDK  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot  
**Branch:** debug/0.0-failure  

## Task Objective
Install Flutter SDK on Windows system as specified in Sprint 0.0 Task 0.0.1 of the UMO Project Plan. The task requires Flutter to be installed and available in PATH, with `flutter doctor -v` showing no unresolved issues.

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt #1: Windows Package Manager (winget)
**Command:** `winget install --id=Flutter.Flutter`  
**Result:** FAILED  
**Error:** "No package found matching input criteria"  
**Analysis:** The package ID `Flutter.Flutter` specified in the plan does not exist in winget repository.

### Attempt #2: Dart SDK via winget (prerequisite approach)
**Command:** `winget install Google.DartSDK`  
**Result:** FAILED  
**Error:** Package installed but not available in PATH. `dart --version` returned "command not recognized"  
**Analysis:** Installation succeeded but PATH configuration failed.

### Attempt #3: Chocolatey Package Manager
**Command:** `choco install flutter`  
**Result:** FAILED  
**Error:** Lock file access denied and permission issues  

## Final Error Message and Stack Trace

```
Chocolatey v2.4.3
flutter not installed. An error occurred during installation:
 Unable to obtain lock file access on 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\502c2f6a626861e353f89b92b9eac93c23c9d8de' for operations on 'C:\ProgramData\chocol
latey\lib\flutter'. This may mean that a different user or administrator is holding this lock and that this process does not have permission to access i
it. If no other process is currently performing an operation on this file it may mean that an earlier NuGet process crashed and left an inaccessible loc
ck file, in this case removing the file 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\502c2f6a626861e353f89b92b9eac93c23c9d8de' will allow NuGet to continue.

Chocolatey installed 0/1 packages. 1 packages failed.
Failures
 - flutter (exited 1) - flutter not installed.
```

## System Environment Analysis

**Operating System:** Windows  
**Shell:** PowerShell  
**Package Managers Available:**
- winget: ✅ Available (v1.10.390)
- choco: ✅ Available (v2.4.3)
- npm: ✅ Available (based on Firebase CLI installation)

**Current Tool Status:**
- Flutter SDK: ❌ NOT INSTALLED
- Dart SDK: ❌ NOT ACCESSIBLE (may be installed but not in PATH)
- Git: ✅ Available (repository initialized)
- Firebase CLI: ✅ Available (based on environment scripts)

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Package Management Issues:** Both winget and chocolatey have different problems:
   - winget: Incorrect package identifier in project plan
   - chocolatey: Permission/lock file conflicts requiring administrator privileges

2. **PATH Configuration:** Even when packages install, they're not being added to system PATH properly

3. **Administrator Privileges:** Windows package managers require elevated permissions for system-wide installations

## Blocking Dependencies

**Sprint 0.0 Task Dependencies:**
- Task 0.0.2 (Android/Visual Studio dependencies) - BLOCKED
- Task 0.0.3 (Firebase CLI) - ✅ APPEARS AVAILABLE  
- Task 0.0.4 (Environment verification script) - BLOCKED

**Downstream Sprint Dependencies:**
- Sprint 0.1: Initial Project Creation - CAN PROCEED (manual console work)
- Sprint 0.2: Flutter Project Setup - COMPLETELY BLOCKED
- All subsequent development sprints - BLOCKED

## Recommended Human Intervention

1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Manual Flutter SDK installation via official installer (recommended approach):
     1. Go to [Flutter official download page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows).
     2. Download the latest stable Flutter SDK zip file.
     3. Extract the downloaded zip file to `C:\flutter`.
     4. Add `C:\flutter\bin` to your system PATH environment variable:
        - Open Windows Search, type "Environment Variables" and select "Edit the system environment variables".
        - Click "Environment Variables".
        - Under "System variables", select "Path" and click "Edit".
        - Click "New" and add `C:\flutter\bin`.
        - Click "OK" to save changes.
     5. Open a new PowerShell window and run `flutter doctor -v` to verify installation.
     6. Follow any additional instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to install missing dependencies.

2. **Alternative Solutions:**
   - Resolve administrator permission issues with Chocolatey and retry installation:
     - Run PowerShell as administrator.
     - Execute `choco install flutter`.
     - Verify with `flutter doctor -v`.

3. **Plan Updates Needed:**
   - Correct the winget package ID for Flutter or remove winget instructions.
   - Clearly document manual installation steps as fallback.
   - Explicitly include PATH configuration instructions in the installation tasks

## Agent Status
**STUCK:** As defined by the Agent Escalation & Recovery Protocol  
**Next Action:** Awaiting human intervention and new instructions  
**Branch:** debug/0.0-failure (preserved with failing state)  
**Rollback Available:** Yes (git repository initialized with clean state)
